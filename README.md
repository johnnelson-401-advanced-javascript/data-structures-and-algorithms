# Reverse an Array  

* Code-Challenge to make a function that reverses the order of an array.

## Challenge
 Take an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
Create a new array,
Take the last item of the provided array,
Put it into the new array,
loop back to the provided array,
subtracting from the index each time through

# Shift and Array  

* Code-Challenge to make a function that shifts all elements of an array.

## Challenge
 Take an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available, return an array with elements shifted.

## Approach & Efficiency
Loop the array,
Then take the index of i,
And set it equal to the next item in the array,
Add the new Element to the end of the array, 

(it was found that going in reverse was faster and more effective.)
